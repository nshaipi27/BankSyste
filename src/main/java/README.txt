    This is the Bank System Simulator. It allows the user to 1. create a bank account, 2. see list of bank accounts,
    3. check transaction history for any account, 4. check account balance for any account, 5. make a withdrawal,
    6. make a deposit, and 7. make a transfer.

Description
    This project is split up into four classes: Account, Bank, Transaction, and Bank System. The account class handles
    the creation of accounts and stores transaction histories for each account. The Bank class handles the creation of
    banks and stores the accounts that get created under the bank. The Transaction class handles withdrawals, deposits,
    and transfers. The BankSystem class takes all of these classes and creates a user-friendly interface in which the
    classes interact with each other to create bank accounts, store them in the banks, create transactions, etc.
